Synopsis:               Postmaster ESMTP Server
Description:            Postmaster implements an ESMTP server. Given a configuration,
                        it starts up and listens for incoming SMTP connections, handles
                        them, and pipes the accepted e-mail messages into an arbitrary
                        local mailer of your choice. A good local mailer is Procmail.
                        Beyond that, you can configure and modify every little step
                        of the SMTP transaction. All the real work is done through
                        call-back functions.
