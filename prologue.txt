Postmaster implements an ESMTP server. Given a configuration, it
starts up and listens for incoming SMTP connections, handles
them, and pipes the accepted e-mail messages into an arbitrary
local mailer of your choice. A good local mailer is Procmail.
Beyond that, you can configure and modify every little step of
the SMTP transaction. All the real work is done through call-back
functions.
